Goal by midnight tonight 11/20/23:

    * Serial SVD (thin, k-approx) (values/vectors) (by hand and LAPACK)
    * Distributed SVD (thin, k-approx) (values/vectors) (by hand and LAPACK/SCALAPACK)

======================================================================================

* Serial SVD (values: high priority, vectors: medium priority)
    * direct LAPACK
    * orthogonal iteration
    * orthogonal iteration with ritz acceleration
    * orthogonal iteration with lanzcos acceleration
    * fast Monte Carlo algorithm (randomized)

* Distributed SVD (values: high priority, vectors: medium priority)
    * direct SCALAPACK
    * Hauser/Goodman or Boutsidis/Woodruff
